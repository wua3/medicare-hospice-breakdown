                <p>In the United States, over 1.4 million patients live out their last days in hospices, end-of-life
                    centers for the terminally ill. But new reports show these centers are riddled with structural
                    deficiencies—the majority failing to meet care planning requirements or properly train their medical
                    staff—and beholden to a bureaucracy that is reluctant to reform. Most hospice patients receive care
                    from Medicare’s network of 4,500 hospices, comprising the bulk of all hospices in the United States.
                    There, patients, many who have fewer than 6 months to live, are meant to access treatment for pain
                    alleviation, medical support and comfort in their final days of life. But gaps in care mean those
                    key functions are only being realized in the best-case.</p>
                <p>For most, the hospice system is falling way short: according to reports released by the <b>Office of
                        the Inspector General of the Department of Health & Human Services</b> on July 3rd, 2019, <span class="highlight">more
                    than 80% of hospices were deemed ‘deficient’, or failed to meet one or more of Medicare’s hospice health and safety
                    standards</span>, between 2012 and 2016.</p>
                <p>Notably, those standards are both wide ranging and foundational to ensuring quality care for the
                    terminally ill: they cover everything from what clinical records must be kept for each patient, to
                    the thorough vetting of staff members, to the standards of controlling and preventing infections. In
                    short, they’re key to regulating the quality of care.</p>
                <p>Here’s what you should know from the Inspector General’s reports—and what new findings mean for the
                    future of hospice care.</p>

                    Inspector General reviews data on deficiencies and complaints from 2012 to 2016 to identify key
                    vulnerabilities in the Medicare hospice system.</p>
                <p>The first report is a nationwide study on hospice deficiencies and discusses statistical findings,
                    common deficiencies, and recommendations. <span class="highlight">95% of the 4,799 hospices under
                        Medicare were surveyed.</span></p>
                <p>The second report examines instances when hospices failed to provide adequate care or take action
                    against abuse. Specifically looking at twelve cases of beneficiary harm from a sample of 50 serious
                    deficiencies cited by State agencies in 2016, the report detailed both the specific harm—which
                    ranged from overlooking caregiver abuse to an uninvestigated pain control grievance—faced by
                    patients and how the case was handled.</p>

            <article class="panel" id="inside">
                <h2>Inside Medicare hospices</h2>
                <h3>What exactly is a deficiency?</h3>
                <p>A <b>deficiency</b> is a violation of one of Medicare’s Conditions of Participation, <span
                        class="highlight">which are federal requirements to participate in the program.</span> The
                    Inspector General writes that they “consist of standards for health and safety [and] are intended to
                    ensure the quality of care and services provided by hospices.”</p>
                <p>These deficiencies are cited by Medicare's surveyors and can fall into two categories:
                    <b>condition-level</b> and <b>standard-level</b>. The condition-level deficiency is what is
                    informally referred to as a “serious” deficiency, and it is cited when requirements are violated to
                    the extent that the hospice cannot fully provide adequate care or that the violation directly
                    concerns the “health and safety of patients.”</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">A third of hospices had complaints filed against them</span>, and for almost
                    half of those hospices, the complaints were severe. Further, 300 hospices were identified as poor
                    performers in 2016, which is 18% of the hospices surveyed in 2016. 88% of them had a history of
                    other violations.</p>

                <h3>The stakes of hospice</h3>
                <p>In 1967, Cicely Saunders pioneered the modern hospice care system, which embraced the patient as an
                    individual to be treated with dignity and compassion. In 1986, hospice became a Medicare benefit.
                    Throughout the next few decades, enrollment into hospices steadily increased as funding and Medicare
                    reimbursement rates did as well.</p>
                <p>The report concludes that 87%⁠—the vast majority⁠—of hospices fail to meet the requirements outlined
                    by <b>Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)</b>. One in every <i>five</i> hospices failed to meet
                    the requirements in a way that encroached on either its ability to provide care or the wellness of
                    its patients.</p>
                <p>Besides the obvious tragedy of systems failing to provide services that its beneficiaries place trust
                    (and dollars) into to provide, the population within hospices is, as you’d imagine of those seeking
                    end-of-life-care, especially vulnerable and often unable to advocate for themselves. As the
                    Inspector General writes, “[hospice patients] have the right to be free from abuse, neglect,
                    mistreatment, and misappropriation of patient property.”</p>
                <p>That population is rapidly growing. <span class="highlight">From 2006 to 2017, the number of Medicare
                        beneficiaries for hospice care rose from 930,000 to 1.4 million.</span> And as Medicare’s
                    hospice system serves more patients, its financing has increased as well. In 2007, $10 billion was
                    spent for Medicare hospice care; in 2017, that number was $17.8 billion. </p>

                <h3>Current systems for accountability and reporting harm are failing.</h3>
                <p>In the second report, the Inspector General covers twelve extreme cases of abuse and neglect. The
                    examples run the gamut: an Alzheimer’s patient developed pressure ulcers during hospice care; left
                    untreated, they became gangrenous. Maggots developed around another beneficiary’s feeding tube. For
                    one more, a hospice did not recognize signs of possible sexual assault.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">With guidelines unclear and discretion commonly left to the hospice, individual instances of abuse
                    and neglect are likely to repeat with little oversight.</span> And that’s assuming the violation is even
                    reported to begin with—which, as the next section shows, is a huge if.</p>

                <h4>Standards for reporting harm are loosely held</h4>
                <div class="graphic-wrapper">
                    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/reporting.css">
                    <div id="reporting">
                    </div>
                    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
                    <script src="scripts/reporting.js"></script>
                </div>

                <h4>Accountability is rarely a consequence of reporting harm</h4>
                <p>Citing a situation as “immediate jeopardy” is the highest level of action a Medicare surveyor can
                    take and indicates serious beneficiary harm, which requires corrective action on the part of the
                    hospice. <span class="highlight">However, in the 12 cases of extreme harm at different hospices,
                        only 5 of these hospices were cited for immediate jeopardy.</span> Furthermore, the only
                    requirement for the hospice after being cited for immediate jeopardy is to submit a plan for
                    change⁠: Staff members are rarely disciplined and the procedure for following up is difficult.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">The only penalty that the CMS can impose is removing a hospice from the Medicare program</span>; the
                    Inspector General writes that “CMS may take this step only if the provider fails to comply with the
                    survey and plan of correction process—for example, by not submitting an adequate plan of correction
                    in a timely manner. CMS has no other penalties at its disposal.” This is an unusual position, as
                    nursing facilities, on the other hand, can face a range of consequences depending on the offense.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Of the twelve hospices in the second report, none faced serious consequences
                        for causing harm.</span> With removal the only penalty for errant hospices, CMS wields this
                    power sparingly, leaving only the hospice’s internal correction process to hold itself accountable.
                    But with plans of correction not required to address underlying issues, even after reporting harm,
                    accountability rarely follows because of weak enforcement mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>What's next</h2>
                <p>Concerns have long been raised about the staffing and accountability of hospices under Medicare,
                    especially from the Office of the Inspector General who last year published a separate review of the
                    system’s vulnerabilities outside of strictly care. Citing gaps in provided services, cases of poor
                    quality care, inappropriate billing and related fraud schemes (Medicare hospice fraud costs as much
                    as $60 billion a year), and ways the payment system financially incentivized minimizing services and
                    maintaining low-needs beneficiaries for as long as they could, the Inspector made several
                    recommendations, half of which were accepted by CMS.</p>
                <p>For the two July 2019 reports covered in this report, CMS concurred with the majority of the
                    Inspector General’s recommendations. <span class="highlight">Progress on this front, however, is incrementalist, with an
                    inevitable gap between the acceptance of a recommendation and its full implementation.</span> This way, the
                    full force of a recommendation can get dispersed through bureaucratic back-and-forths.</p>
                <p>An example here is illustrative. The Inspector General had recommended CMS to “strengthen
                    requirements for hospices to report abuse, neglect, and other harm.” In CMS’s agreement, it cites an
                    existing requirement for hospices to report verified violations and concludes with a resolution to
                    “review our interpretive guidance for opportunities to clarify existing guidance on reporting these
                    violations.” Yet the full recommendation specifically recommends several changes to the Conditions
                    of Participation terms—something not even mentioned in CMS’s response.</p>
                <p>In another recommendation, the Inspector General requested that Hospice Compare (CMS’s website for
                    patients choosing hospices) should include state agency survey reports. This was rejected by CMS
                    under the following rationale: because CMS does not currently have authorization to publish survey
                    results from accrediting organizations, to only include state survey results would be misleading, as
                    they would only represent 60% of hospice surveys. In this manner, no findings about the quality of
                    care from public survey results would be represented on Hospice Care until all findings would be
                    able to.</p>
                <p>These two reports are an illuminating look into the processes of change within CMS—namely, that as
                    CMS has limited resources and oversight, they are slow to update requirements and measures of
                    accountability, instead opting to review and revise educational materials. Importantly, these
                    vulnerabilities manifest in consistent and common deficiencies in standards of care. Reporting harm
                    and correcting it are two separate and distinct procedures with their own obstacles. <span class="highlight">Plans of
                    correction, for example, ought to be scrutinized and enforced, with CMS able to levy intermediate
                    sanctions proportional to consequence, instead of only expelling the very few hospices who
                    completely cross the line.</span> The various solutions to increase safeguards are many, but the common
                    theme is clear: only with increasing oversight can we truly secure for hospice patients the dignity,
                    rest, and care they deserve.</p>
