                <p>Of the 4,500 U.S. hospices in Medicare, more than 80% were deficient between 2012 and 2016.</p>
                <p>Two critical reports were released on July 3rd by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health & Human Services. Reviewing deficiencies and complaints from 2012 to 2016, the reports identified key vulnerabilities in the US hospice system under Medicare and how they impact its 1.4 million patients. In certain instances when hospices failed to provide adequate care or take action against abuse, patients faced serious harm.

                <h4>Scope of the reports</h4>
                <p>The first of the reports is a relatively extensive nationwide study on hospice deficiencies. It’s unique in that both hospices surveyed directly by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and hospices surveyed by accrediting organizations are accounted for.* <span class="highlight">95% of the 4,799 hospices under Medicare were surveyed.</span></p>
                <p>The second report dove into twelve cases of beneficiary harm from a sample of 50 serious deficiencies cited by State agencies in 2016. For each case, the report also looked at how the case was handled.</p>

                <h2>Inside Medicare hospices</h2>
                <h3>What exactly is a deficiency?</h3>
                <p>A <b>deficiency</b> is a violation of one of the Conditions of Participation. These conditions are federal requirements to participate in Medicare. The Inspector General writes that they “consist of standards for health and safety … [and] are intended to ensure the quality of care and services provided by hospices.”</p>
                <p>These deficiencies are cited by surveyors, and can fall into two categories: <b>condition-level</b> and <b>standard-level</b>. The condition-level deficiency is what is informally referred to as a “serious” deficiency, and is cited when requirements are so violated that the hospice is limited in its ability to provide adequate care, or that it directly negatively affects the “health and safety of patients.”</p>
                <h4>Most common deficiencies</h4>

                        <p>300 hospices were identified as poor performers in 2016, which is 18% of the hospices surveyed in 2016. 88% of them had a history of other violations.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Current systems for accountability and reporting harm are failing.</h3>
                <p>In the second report, the Inspector General covers twelve heartbreaking cases of abuse and neglect. An Alzheimer’s patient developed pressure ulcers during hospice care. Left untreated, they became gangrenous. Maggots developed around another beneficiary’s feeding tube. For another, a hospice did not recognize signs of possible sexual assault.</p>

                <h4>Standards for reporting harm are loosely held</h4>
                <div class="graphic-wrapper">

                <h4>Accountability is rarely a consequence of reporting harm</h4>
                <p>Citing “immediate jeopardy” is the highest level of action a surveyor can take and indicates beneficiary harm. <span class="highlight">However, in the 12 cases, only 5 hospices were cited for immediate jeopardy, despite the beneficiaries in every circumstance being significantly harmed.</span> Furthermore, the only requirement for the hospice after being cited for immediate jeopardy is to submit a plan for change⁠—staff members are rarely disciplined and it’s difficult to follow up.</p>
                <p>The only penalty that the CMS can impose is removing a hospice from the Medicare program; the Inspector General writes that “CMS may take this step only if the provider fails to comply with the survey and plan of correction process—for example, by not submitting an adequate plan of correction in a timely manner. CMS has no other penalties at its disposal.”</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Of the twelve hospices in the second report, none faced serious consequences for causing harm.</span></p>
            </article>

            <article class="panel" id="matter">
                <h2>Why these reports matter</h2>
                <p>Besides the obvious tragedy of systems failing to provide services that its beneficiaries place trust (and dollars) into to provide, it’s especially tragic within hospice care since the population seeking end-of-life-care is, as you’d imagine, vulnerable and often unable to advocate for themselves.</p>
                <p>That population is rapidly growing. <span class="highlight">From 2006 to 2017, the number of Medicare beneficiaries for hospice care jumped from 930,000 to 1.4 million.</span> (Almost all hospices in the U.S. are covered through Medicare.) The report concludes that 87%⁠—the vast majority⁠—of hospices fail to meet the requirements outlined by CMS. One in every five hospices failed to meet the requirements in a way that encroached on either its ability to provide care or the wellness of its patients! While these vulnerabilities are found to be impacting beneficiaries, the Medicare hospice program has grown in both the number of beneficiaries, consequently, its funding. In 2017, $17.8 billion was used for Medicare hospice care.</p>

                <h3>What’s next</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight">Concerns have long been raised about the staffing and accountability of hospices under Medicare</span>, especially from the Office of the Inspector General, who last year published a thorough portfolio of the vulnerabilities in the system. Citing gaps in provided services, cases of poor quality care, inappropriate billing and related fraud schemes (Medicare hospice fraud costs as much as $60 billion a year), and ways the payment system financially incentivized minimizing services and maintaining low-needs beneficiaries for as long as they could, the Inspector made several recommendations, half of which were accepted by CMS.</p>
                <p>For the two July 2019 reports we’re breaking down today, CMS concurred with the vast majority of the Inspector General’s recommendations. <span class="highlight">Progress, however, is incrementalist; the back-and-forth on specific points gets easily lost in bureaucracy.</span> For example, the recommendation to include on Hospice Compare (CMS’s website for patients choosing hospices) the survey reports from state agencies was rejected; the grounds for doing so was that, because CMS does not currently have authorization to publish survey results from accrediting organization, to only include state survey results would be misleading.</p>
                <p>In 1967, Cicely Saunders pioneered the modern hospice care system, which embraced the patient as an individual to be treated with dignity and compassion. It is very difficult to reconcile the cases of neglect and abuse in the July reports, of hospice fraud and of providing intentionally incomplete information in the 2018 report, with this vision of respect and duty.</p>
